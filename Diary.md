Decided on splitting up the code to see the breaking point as running the full implementation timed out the planner resulting in no plans

tests on 1 row and 3 rows are successful with 1 row taking 0.35 seconds on average to solve and the 3 rows implementation taking 0.55 seconds on average by the online solver.

testing 5x9 shows the first significant leap in time going from 1 second to 4.2 seconds on average to find a plan
